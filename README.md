Make sure you have connected the nodeMCU to your laptop. Here I am using two laptops as clients, you can use any one of it.

After you have connected the nodemcu make sure it is visible in the device manager in Ports/COM section and proper drivers are installed.

Then select the above nodemcu board and then click upload arrow in top left corner.
The code begins to upload into the nodemcu and after you get wifi is connected. Then run the client program to chat with the bot.
